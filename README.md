# RandFortran
Example of simple R and Fortran programs that compute the means and variances of sets of uniform random variates and
some statistics on those quantities.

Sample R output:

```
    Number of observations per data set:            100
    Number of data sets:                        1000000
    Average Mean:                                    0.5000192068
    Average Variance:                                0.0833360355
    Standard Error of Mean:                          0.0000288673
    Standard Error of Variance:                      0.0000075392
    Minimum Mean:                                    0.3677907574
    Maximum Mean:                                    0.6419923536
    Minimum Variance:                                0.0501358999
    Maximum Variance:                                0.1214716295
